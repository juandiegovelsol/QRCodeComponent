## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries (Breakpoint 500px, 800px)
- Boxshadow property

### What I learned

We learned how to use properties such as Boxshadow for visual effects inclusion.

```css
#background {
  box-shadow: 4px 15px 15px 7px rgb(0 0 0 / 5%);
}
```

### Continued development

It will be nice to use Grid to create the same layout.
